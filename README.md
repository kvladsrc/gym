# Algorithmic Playground & Coding Challenges

This repository is a curated collection of my programming solutions, algorithm experiments, and learning notes on my computer science journey. You'll find both educational implementations and competitive programming solutions that reflect my problem-solving progress and approaches.

**Note**: Code is written for educational purposes, not optimized for production, and may contain errors. Use as inspiration or reference material.

## Repository Structure

### Codeforces Solutions
`/codeforces` — Solutions from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com):
- Problems from Div3A to Div1E
- Progressive complexity with focus on regular practice

### Algorithms & Data Structures
`/warmup` — Educational implementations of core algorithms, data structures and techniques.

### SICP solutions
`/sicp` — My first experience in programming: exercises from a book that I worked through around 2007.

## Purpose

This repository showcases my journey in programming and algorithms. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference. All constructive feedback is appreciated!
