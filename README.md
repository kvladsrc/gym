# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various programming
challenges and implementations of popular algorithms and data
structures. These implementations originated from warmup drafts and
have not been thoroughly tested. They are not intended for production
use but serve to illustrate the underlying concepts. While they were
initially meant to stay "on the shelf," I decided to share them to
showcase my learning journey.

## Directories

- **codeforces**: Solutions to problems from
  [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), ranging from simple to
  complex. These problems have helped me enhance my problem-solving
  skills across different difficulty levels.

- **warmup**: Raw implementations of various popular algorithms and data structures, such as:
  - Shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, A*, Floyd-Warshall, Ford-Bellman);
  - Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Boyer-Moore string-search algorithms;
  - Binary heap;
  - Disjoint Set Union (DSU);
  - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS);
  - Heap's algorithm for generating permutations;

## Purpose

This repository showcases my journey in programming and
algorithms. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference.
