# Algorithmic Playground & Coding Challenges

> I find that I don't understand things unless I try to program them.

This repository is a curated collection of my programming solutions,
algorithm experiments, and learning notes on my computer science
journey. You'll find both educational implementations and competitive
programming solutions.

**Note**: Code is written for educational purposes, not optimized for
production, and may contain errors.

## Repository Structure

### Codeforces Solutions

`/codeforces` — Solutions from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com).

### Algorithms & Data Structures

`/warmup` — Educational implementations of core algorithms, data
structures and techniques. Tests for this section were written with
the help of Gemini CLI.

### SICP solutions

`/sicp` — My first experience in programming.

## Purpose

This repository showcases my journey in programming and
algorithms. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a
reference. All constructive feedback is appreciated!
