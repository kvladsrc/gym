# Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various programming
challenges and implementations of popular algorithms and data
structures. These implementations originated from warmup drafts and
have not been thoroughly tested. They are not intended for production
use but serve to illustrate the underlying concepts. While they were
initially meant to stay "on the shelf," I decided to share them to
showcase my learning journey.

## Directories

- **codeforces**: Solutions to problems from
  [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), ranging from simple to
  complex. These problems have helped me enhance my problem-solving
  skills across different difficulty levels. An important principle
  for me in the process was and remains regularity; I have tried
  to maintain a routine of daily practice over the long term.

- **warmup**: Raw implementations of various popular algorithms and data structures, such as:
  - Shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, A*,
    Floyd-Warshall, Bellman-Ford);
  - Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Boyer-Moore string-search algorithms;
  - Binary heap;
  - Disjoint Set Union (DSU);
  - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), Longest Increasing Subsequence
    (LIS), and Edit Distance;
  - Binary search;
  - Quick sort, merge sort, counting sort, bubble sort, and
    nth-element;
  - Two-heaps algorithm (median of a stream);
  - Kadane's algorithm (maximum sum subarray);
  - Kruskal's algorithm (minimum spanning tree), Kosaraju's algorithm
    (strongly connected components), DFS & BFS, and graph heuristic
    coloring;
  - Fenwick tree (also known as a binary indexed tree) for partial
    sums;
  - GCD and LCM algorithms;
  - Heap's algorithm for generating permutations.

## Purpose

This repository showcases my journey in programming and
algorithms. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference.
