/*
 * The Boyer-Moore algorithm searches for the occurrence of the
 * pattern string (pattern) in the original string (s). If the pattern
 * is contained in the string as a substring, it returns true;
 * otherwise, it returns false.
 *
 * The algorithm maintains a variable (last) corresponding to the
 * position in the string that is aligned with the last character of
 * the pattern. If the characters at these positions do not match, the
 * algorithm shifts the position to the right. The shift is made by
 * the maximum possible distance to avoid missing any potential
 * occurrences. To achieve this, preprocessing is performed on the
 * pattern, and a table is created where each character in the pattern
 * is mapped to the rightmost position of its occurrence in the
 * pattern. In the event of a mismatch between s[last] and the last
 * character of the pattern, the variable last is increased so that
 * the pattern is shifted to align with the rightmost occurrence of
 * the character s[last] in the pattern. We use the rightmost index of
 * the character to ensure that no possible occurrences are
 * missed. All earlier occurrences are left for later consideration.
